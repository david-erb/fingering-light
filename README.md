# fingering-light

In 2005 for some maker fun I built a computer controlled lighting display.

There were 3 metal hoops about 4 feet in diameter arranged in a 3d "globe" pattern.
Attached to the hoops were standard christmas lights.
In the middle was a vertical finger, also wrapped with lights.
The lights were powered by a 300W inverter running off a 12V battery.

The control box had some hardware-store slider-type dimmer switches.  
I used servos to move the sliders.  Some of the lights were controlled by electromechanical relays.
It was noisy when operated!

The software was an HTML page running in a C# dashboard. The C# talked to DLL's written in C for controlling Phidgets USB devices.
You built sequences for the light changes by editing trend chart.
Someday if I find the hard disk that has the code on it, I'll post it here.

I put it on top of my old school bus and drove it around town and down to the shore.
The Coast Guard sent over a crew to see what I was doing there.
One doesn't see much like that in our little town.

Here are some pictures in action
